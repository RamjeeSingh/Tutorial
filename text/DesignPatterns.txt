a. Creational
 Deals with Object instantiation.

1. SingleTon : Resource Management
2. Factory : Loose Coupling.System depends on 3rd party implementaion. Interface implemnted differently and system needs to deal with all 
3. Builder: Builder pattern is used to instantiate complex object. we can set lot of attribs and call build to build the Object. AudioTrack.builder(set attribs, set Usage, set Transfer mode,set Performance mode, etc ) then call build where build usage all set args to instantiate/build approriate object. Bridge gap b/w actual object internals.



b. Structural

Adapter : Wrap glue two non compliant class
